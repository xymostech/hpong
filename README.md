### An experiment in using Haskell for games
--------

This is me messing around with Haskell (because its type system is _awesome_),
and at the same time, seeing if it is a viable language for making games with.
Because of its nice type system, the OpenGL interfaces are much cleaner, and so
I'm seeing if it is easier/more fun to write things using Haskell than in C++
(as I did in the past). So far, things are looking okay: ![Demo
